# Literature Review – Using AI to Mitigate Railway Disruption in the UK  
MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  
University of Liverpool  

This repository contains a literature review submitted as part of the MSc in Data Science and AI at the University of Liverpool. The review explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to mitigate railway disruption in the United Kingdom.

## Overview

Railway delays and disruptions — often caused by signal failures, point faults, and asset fatigue — are a major challenge for UK infrastructure operators. This review investigates how AI methods are being applied to detect, predict, and respond to these disruptions, and evaluates the effectiveness, limitations, and deployment challenges of such systems.
